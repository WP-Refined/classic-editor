# WP Classic Editor

### Purpose

This project started as a way to learn more about [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/), [Vuestic UI](https://vuestic.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). 

The end goal was to have a very simple app that could connect to a WordPress website, load posts, and provide the ability to edit those posts via a [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) editor.

While the app does also compile across different platforms with Tauri and run, there are still some limitations with the current beta version of Tauri, as well as further changes that would need to be made to complete the event hook persisting settings.
